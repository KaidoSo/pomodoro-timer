<h1>Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project - POMODORO TIMER</h1>
<a href="https://kaidoso.github.io/pomodoro-timer/" target="_blank">https://kaidoso.github.io/pomodoro-timer/</a>

<h3>What does it do and what need does it fulfil?</h3>
The project is created by using skills I have acquired during the several months of studying coding after work, to create a Pomodoro timer website while utilizing HTML, CSS and JS. The purpose of the website is to allow user to use a timer and keep track of their productivity.

<h3>UX</h3>
<ul>
As a user I want to...
<li>understand what the function of this website is. There is an About section, that explains the functions of the website.</li>
<li>start timer for predetermined times (5, 15 or 25min). There are buttons to do so.</li>
<li>start timer with custom amount of minutes. There is an option to enter them in the input field and press enter to start the timer.</li>
<li>hear when the timer is up. The sound plays when the timer reaches 0.</li>
<li>keep track of how many 25 min segments I have done to keep track of productivity. There are tomatos user can click to keep track of "fruits of their labor".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functionality of the project</h3>
The website is fully responsive. The timer buttons for predetermined times work and so does the input field for custom time input.
The size of the text and tomatos are changed along with the screen size. 

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>
I'd like to extend this project in the future with extension of current webpage or maybe separate page for keeping records of how many tomatos user filled each day. 

<h3>Technologies used to create the project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>FontAwesome</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>GIT</li>
<li>GITHUB</li>
<li>Google Chrome developer tools</li></ul>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
Website was coded in Visual Studio Code,a local GIT directory was used for version control using commands:
<ul>
<li>git init</li>
<li>git status</li>
<li>git add . </li></ul>
and then uploaded to GITHUB using commands:
<ul>
<li>git commit -m</li>
<li>git remote add origin <a href="https://github.com/KaidoSo/pomodoro-timer.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/KaidoSo/pomodoro-timer.git</a></li>
<li>git push -u origin master</li></ul>
Following uploads were performed by commands:
<ul>
<li>git add .</li>
<li>git commit -m</li>
<li>git push</li>
Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: <a href="https://kaidoso.github.io/pomodoro-timer/" target="_blank">https://kaidoso.github.io/pomodoro-timer/</a>

<h3>Testing</h3>
Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality as well as look and feel (in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. All buttons were tested for functionality and producing a sound upon completion of timer. The website was successfully tested in google chrome, internet explorer (does not support all the colors, but functionality is there) and my own phone Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact.

<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
Making the countdown timer fill up with different color as the timer ticks away was in my initial scope, but I could not make it work the way I wanted it to, so I had to leave it out to be able to meet the time constraints I am currently facing with this course.
<br>
I acknowledge the fact that size of fonts and icons are not optimized for every screensize, but the scope of this project is to prove the knowledge obtained so far in JS and due to forementioned time constraints, I opted for not consentrating on that aspect fully.

<h3>Work based on other code</h3>
I used this instructional video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAaf7-WuJJQ" target="_blank">Vanilla JS Countdown Timer</a> as the backbone of my timer JS code. I also used some guidance from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> website.

<h3>What changed after user design experience (UDX) phase</h3>
The initial idea of having a countdown visuals inside the pieChart was scrapped. But I am definitely revisiting this project at a later date, when I have more time on my hands, to make it visually more pleasing and adding the visuals I had in mind.
